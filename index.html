			<h3>My Learning Style</h3>

			<p>50% Visual</p>
			<p>40% Tactile</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>During my tenure as a project manager I had the privilege of overseeing some large scale projects.  My biggest job to date was responding to a strip mall that suffered a massive sewage back up.
					Roughly 12,000 square feet was affected, including a 10,000 square foot Family Dollar retail store, a 1000 square foot hair salon and a 1000 square foot office space that was vacant.  All three spaces required logistical and organizational decisions to get them addressed in a timely and safe manner.
					Estimates were required for each space to be submitted to insurance.  Our company billed just over $140,000 for 5 weeks of work.</li>
				<li>My career as a restoration specialist also saw periods of extreme demand such as the monsoon season of 2014.  One of major clients was the University of New Mexico.  A single vendor cannot handle an account of this size, as a result my company shared the response of addressing flooding and dry out in 20 or so building spread across the campus.
					Specifically I was tasked with 5 buildings, including one of significant historical value which required the most expertise and care.  Its a building right one the corner of Central and University named Hodgin Hall.  It was originally constructed in 1892 and then renovated in 2011.  It’s consists of 3 floors and a basement.
					All with gorgeous hard wood floors, lathe and plaster walls and ceilings as well as historically important pictures, paintings and antique furniture.  A roof leak on the very top made its way down through all floors and settled on the hard wood in the basement.  I brought in speciality drying and equipment and used infrared thermography.
					I was also tasked with a an anthropology wing, a section of the Parish Hall Library and also a few sections of a performing arts center.</li>
				<li>Over my career I’ve obtained six industry certifications.  I was able to obtain a Journeyman Water Restorer status.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3>Qualitative Features</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I have a good sense of organization.  It has aided me immensely but has also slowed me down as time as I tend to be a perfectionist.</li>
				<li>I have spent many many years talking with customers, I have learned to be a good listener.  It has aided me in terms of communicating expectations but sometimes I can get stuck down the weeds of trying to communicate everything all at once.</li>
				<li>I have a good sense of team-work.  I love helping out and I tend to not ever sit idle.  Sometimes it can be to my detriment as well because I’ve spent a good amount of time as the supervisor and sometimes I forget to listen to other’s ideas instead of just going with my first idea.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Get into career that is both fulfilling and pays well</li>
				<li>Coding skills & foundation</li>
				<li>Developing games that others can enjoy</li>
			</ol>
			<br>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>This week started out overwhelming but as each day passed I found that I was more and more comfortable as well as confident.
				The lecture portions can be confusing as Dylan moves pretty fast but by Friday I found myself better at taking notes.
				George also reminded me that I have access to Dylan's past lecture notes so I will definitely be looking back on some of those to add more to my notes.
				I am a little nervous about setting up the database/SQL portion of the data-design project but I will make it through!  I am very much looking forward to next week!</p>
			<h3>Functions Homework</h3>
			<p>This week I really struggled with the functions assignment.  I tried to spend a good amount of time watching tutorials on YouTube but I am still struggling with them as far the homework assignment was concerned
			I hope there are more assignments to offset how badly I did on this one.  The snap challenges regarding functions have also been hard.  I will be spending some significant time outside class trying to understand them better.</p>
