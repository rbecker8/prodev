			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>This week started out overwhelming but as each day passed I found that I was more and more comfortable as well as confident.
				The lecture portions can be confusing as Dylan moves pretty fast but by Friday I found myself better at taking notes.
				George also reminded me that I have access to Dylan's past lecture notes so I will definitely be looking back on some of those to add more to my notes.
				I am a little nervous about setting up the database/SQL portion of the data-design project but I will make it through!  I am very much looking forward to next week!</p>
