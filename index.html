			<h2>Homework Activities</h2>
			<h3>My Learning Style</h3>
			<p><strong>Visual</strong></p>
			<p>10% Auditory</p>
			<p>50% Visual</p>
			<p>40% Tactile</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>During my tenure as a project manager I had the privilege of overseeing some large scale projects.  My biggest job to date was responding to a strip mall that suffered a massive sewage back up.
					Roughly 12,000 square feet was affected, including a 10,000 square foot Family Dollar retail store, a 1000 square foot hair salon and a 1000 square foot office space that was vacant.  All three spaces required logistical and organizational decisions to get them addressed in a timely and safe manner.
					Estimates were required for each space to be submitted to insurance.  Our company billed just over $140,000 for 5 weeks of work.</li>
				<li>My career as a restoration specialist also saw periods of extreme demand such as the monsoon season of 2014.  One of our major clients was the University of New Mexico.  A single vendor cannot handle an account of this size, as a result my company shared the response of addressing flooding and dry out in 20 or so building spread across the campus.
					Specifically I was tasked with 5 buildings, including one of significant historical value which required the most expertise and care.  Its a building right one the corner of Central and University named Hodgin Hall.  It was originally constructed in 1892 and then renovated in 2011.  It’s consists of 3 floors and a basement.
					All with gorgeous hard wood floors, lathe and plaster walls and ceilings as well as historically important pictures, paintings and antique furniture.  A roof leak on the very top made its way down through all floors and settled on the hard wood in the basement.  I brought in speciality drying and equipment and used infrared thermography.
					I was also tasked with a an anthropology wing, a section of the Parish Hall Library and also a few sections of a performing arts center.</li>
				<li>Over my career I’ve obtained six industry certifications.  I was able to obtain a Journeyman Water Restorer status.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3>Qualitative Features</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I have a good sense of organization.  It has aided me immensely but has also slowed me down as time as I tend to be a perfectionist.</li>
				<li>I have spent many many years talking with customers, I have learned to be a good listener.  It has aided me in terms of communicating expectations but sometimes I can get stuck down the weeds of trying to communicate everything all at once.</li>
				<li>I have a good sense of team-work.  I love helping out and I tend to not ever sit idle.  Sometimes it can be to my detriment as well because I’ve spent a good amount of time as the supervisor and sometimes I forget to listen to other’s ideas instead of just going with my first idea.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>My buddy Joy and I chose these two photos to represent how our path through this bootcamp is very strict and set in stone initially.
			And our path opens to the edge of our imaginations once we make it out in the real world!</p>

			<h2>Balance</h2>
			<p>In my life I try to achieve balance by spending time with family and my two dogs.  Every week I attend church and dinner with my sister's family.
			I also spend a chunk of my weekend over at my parents helping in the yard and around the house.  When a project gets hard or I get frustrated, I take some time
			to play with my dogs.  They love playing tug of war as well as general rough housing!  Even a short break spent with them can make all the difference.

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>This week started out overwhelming but as each day passed I found that I was more and more comfortable as well as confident.
				The lecture portions can be confusing as Dylan moves pretty fast but by Friday I found myself better at taking notes.
				George also reminded me that I have access to Dylan's past lecture notes so I will definitely be looking back on some of those to add more to my notes.
				I am a little nervous about setting up the database/SQL portion of the data-design project but I will make it through!  I am very much looking forward to next week!</p>
			<h3>Functions Homework</h3>
			<p>This week I really struggled with the functions assignment.  I tried to spend a good amount of time watching tutorials on YouTube but I am still struggling with them as far the homework assignment was concerned
			I hope there are more assignments to offset how badly I did on this one.  The snap challenges regarding functions have also been hard.  I will be spending some significant time outside class trying to understand them better.</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week started out pretty rough with functions but as the week is coming to a close I am feeling very good about databases.  Writing class objects with accessors, mutators and constructors turned out to be a lot easier
			than I thought it would be.  Same thing with actually inserting data into my databases.  The snap challenge on Friday was the most confident I have felt about one!  It felt great to help a few of my classmates as well.  I am feeling
			great about both projects, the PWP and data design.  Bring on week 3!</p>
